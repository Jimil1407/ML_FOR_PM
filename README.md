# 📧 Spam Detection Model

Welcome to the **Ham-Spam Detection Model**! This project implements a spam detection system using the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify email messages as either 'ham' (not spam) or 'spam' (unwanted). It provides an efficient and accurate method for filtering out unwanted messages from your inbox.

## 🔍 Overview

The Ham-Spam Detection Model leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier, to distinguish between ham and spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails and can be used to classify new messages with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Spam Classification:** Identifies whether an email is spam or ham.
- **Naive Bayes Algorithm:** Uses a probabilistic approach for classification.
- **Efficient Filtering:** Helps manage and clean your email inbox by filtering out spam.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleans and prepares the email data for training.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed email dataset.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Classifies new email messages as spam or ham based on the trained model.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jimil1407/ML_hackathon.git
   cd ML_hackathon

2. **Run the notebook:**
   - it will generate a pickle file, use that in the streamlit app.
   ```bash
    streamlit run host_website.py

## 📝 Requirements

- **Python:** Programming language used for implementation.
- **scikit-learn:** For machine learning functionalities.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical operations.
- **streamlit:** For creating the web interface.
